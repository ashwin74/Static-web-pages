		<div class="d2">"Entrepreneurship is the art of starting a business, basically a startup company offering
								creative product, process or service. We can say that it is an activity full of creativity. An
								entrepreneur perceives everything as a chance and displays bias in taking decision to
								exploit the chance."

		<div class="d3">"An entrepreneur is a creator or a designer who designs new ideas and business processes
						according to the market requirements and his/her own passion. To be a successful
						entrepreneur, it is very important to have managerial skill and strong team building
						abilities. Leadership attributes are a sign of successful entrepreneurs. Some political
						economists regard leadership, management ability, and team building skills to be the
						essential qualities of an entrepreneur."
